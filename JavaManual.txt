How to use the program
1) add two courses
2) add two teachers
( remember the roll number of the teacher, you will need it for accessing the information, related to teachers, 
also Assign Sections to the teacher, The sections are created, when you assign the teachers to the sections, )
3) assign courses to the teacher, you can assign one course, or both the courses
4) Now Add Students( remember their roll No)
When asked to assign sections to students, assign the above created sections only

After this you can use all the display functions, and do what you want

Cardinality of the College DataBase Management System




stuff you can add
1) try to add, something such that it lets you go back to the main menus
2) changes made, duplicate values for course cannot be added

flaws
Note: how this thing works is, when you add a course, and assign a teacher, you also have to let the teacher know that this course has been asssigned to him, you do this by assigning 
NOTE: Change your code such that, once you are adding a course, it only asks for the course name, it dosn't ask for the teacher
1) duplicate entries can be created, I have to use a hashmap for removing this flaw
2) now the program, works in a sequential order, i.e. it should be exectued in the order shown above, for it to function properly, to solve this, i need to create more functions, to handle the logic for the classes individually
3) I can change from the main menu to the additional menu, but i can't go back, to solve this, i need to create another main class, that has both of this menus implemented, to switch between them
4) To set some information of teachers, i need to write their roll No, try to implement a method, that lets users see avaiable teachers along with their roll_No, so that they don't have to remeber the roll number
5) implement the same thing for the students also 
6) when you are adding courses, if there are no teachers created, and you enter a teacher's name, return, there are no teachers available, rather then saying teacher not found
7) add more functionality in the additional options


different way to execute the program
1) run Teachers first
2) assign sections to the teachers, you cannot assign courses, because there are no couerses yet
3) check if assign teacher to course is working(It is working)



start with the courses, add the courses, 
then add the teachers
then add the students
